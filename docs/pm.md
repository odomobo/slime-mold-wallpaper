# Project Management!

We need to reduce scope. For phase 1, let's get some minimal stuff working:

* Minimal extra html+javascript to make it easy to tweak parameters
* Minimal required parameters. No randomized parameters
* Paremeters must be orthogonal.

Once the above is complete, then we can publish it!

TODO:

* have agoraphobia amount parameter instead of trail density
* scale parameters... which?
* clamp angle to 60 degrees?
* need to make a cool name...
* should targetRotationSpeed be squared in blurAmountPerFrame???

# Phase 2:

Give a "random" button option for each thing, which hides its control. Add a "randomizer speed" option that makes parameters either change quickly or slowly.
