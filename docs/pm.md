# Project Management!

We need to reduce scope. For phase 1, let's get some minimal stuff working:

* Minimal extra html+javascript to make it easy to tweak parameters
* Minimal required parameters. No randomized parameters
* Paremeters must be orthogonal.

Once the above is complete, then we can publish it!

TODO:

* clamp sense angle to 90 degrees
* figure out random movements?
* scale parameters

# Phase 2:

* If actual FPS dips below target FPS, should we speed up ants? Maybe not...
